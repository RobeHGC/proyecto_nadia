## LLM Cost Impact Analysis
<!-- IMPORTANT: Analyze how this change affects LLM API costs -->

### Cost Impact Assessment
- [ ] **INCREASES** costs (new API calls, longer prompts, less caching)
- [ ] **DECREASES** costs (better caching, fewer retries, more efficient prompts)
- [ ] **NEUTRAL** impact (no change to LLM usage patterns)
- [ ] **UNKNOWN** impact (needs measurement)

### Cost Details
<!-- If there's a cost impact, provide details: -->
- **Estimated cost change per user/day**: `$X.XX` or `X% increase/decrease`
- **Token usage changes**: 
  - Input tokens: `+/- X tokens per request`
  - Output tokens: `+/- X tokens per request`
- **API call frequency changes**: `+/- X calls per user/day`
- **Caching impact**: `Improves/Reduces cache hit rate by X%`

### Cost Justification
<!-- If costs increase, justify the value: -->
- **Business value**: 
- **User experience improvement**: 
- **Alternative approaches considered**:
