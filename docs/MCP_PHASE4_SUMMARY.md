## 🎓 Usage Patterns

### **Daily Development Workflow**
```bash
# Morning routine
make mcp-health                    # Check system status
git pull origin main               # Get latest changes

# Feature development
make mcp-debug USER=12345         # Debug user issues
make mcp-slow-api ENDPOINT=/api/messages  # Investigate performance

# Before committing
make mcp-pre-commit               # Automated via git hooks
git commit -m "feature: new functionality"  # Triggers security validation
```

### **CI/CD Pipeline Flow**
```bash
# Automated on every push/PR
1. Security Gate (BLOCKING) → ./scripts/mcp-workflow.sh security-check
2. Health Validation      → ./scripts/mcp-workflow.sh health-check  
3. Performance Baseline   → ./scripts/mcp-workflow.sh perf-baseline
4. Deployment Validation  → ./scripts/deployment-health-check.sh
5. Success Notification   → Alert sent to team channels
```

### **Alert Management**
```bash
# Setup alerts (one-time)
make mcp-setup-alerts             # Interactive configuration

# Monitor alerts
make mcp-alert-stats              # View statistics
make mcp-test-alerts              # Test all channels

# Send manual alerts
curl -X POST "/api/mcp/alerts/send?alert_type=maintenance&message=System maintenance&severity=INFO"
```
