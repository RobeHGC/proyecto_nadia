# Session Summary - June 27, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. LLM Router AttributeError
**Problem**: `'SupervisorAgent' object has no attribute 'llm_router'`
**Root Cause**: Router initialization code was in `reload_llm1_persona()` instead of `__init__()`
**Solution**: Moved initialization to constructor, ensuring router is available on startup

### 2. LLM2 Incorrect Behavior
**Problem**: LLM2 was conversing with LLM1's output instead of refining it
**Example**: 
- User: "what are you doing?"
- LLM1: "just surviving anatomy class!"
- LLM2: "haha, i feel you! that class sounds intense üòÇ" ‚ùå

**Solution**: Updated prompt to be explicit about editor role:
```python
content = f"ORIGINAL DRAFT:\n\"{current_message}\"\n\nREFORMAT TASK: Take the exact same message content and rewrite it in casual bubbles using [GLOBO] separators. You are an EDITOR, not a conversational partner. Keep the same meaning but make it more humanized and casual."
```

### 3. Configuration Updates
- **Debouncing**: Changed from 10s to 60s for better message batching
- **Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md with latest fixes and architecture

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `agents/supervisor_agent.py`: LLM router initialization
2. `llms/stable_prefix_manager.py`: LLM2 refinement prompt
3. `.env`: TYPING_DEBOUNCE_DELAY=60
4. `CLAUDE.md`: Documentation updates

### Key Insights
- The LLM2 prompt needs to be very explicit about its role as an editor/reformatter
- Dynamic router initialization must happen in `__init__` for proper object lifecycle
- 60-second debouncing provides better context for multi-message conversations

### Verified Systems
- ‚úÖ Redis conversation history (50 messages per user)
- ‚úÖ Context isolation between users
- ‚úÖ Last 6 messages used for LLM1 context
- ‚úÖ Auto-reload detecting file changes
- ‚úÖ .gitignore protecting sensitive files

## Production Status
System is stable and ready for production use with all critical bugs fixed.
